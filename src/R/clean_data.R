#' @title mouseview data handler

#' @description
#' This is a function that takes the data reported from mouseview
#' converts it to a vector, takes the absolute difference between
#' positions on that vector, and then calculates the average
#' movement for that vector.
#' 
#' @details
#' The mouseview data comes in as an array but stored as character
#' form when initially loaded in from CSV. This function splits up
#' the array, converts it all to numerics, takes the difference between
#' values in the array, and then calculates the average. This gives
#' a average movement across the x and y axis. For recording of time,
#' it records the average amount of time taken between movements.
#' It does this for each trial and records which trial this happened for.
#' 
#' @param data_frame A data.table object that is essentially from
#' the raw csv.
#' @param var A string indicating which column to perform this on.
#' @param time Is it the time column or not.
#' 
#' @return list_num A mean value of movement on that particular axis.

#' @title clean a csv
#' 
#' @description
#' This function takes a single csv file from study 1
#' and cleans it to work in a data.table object.
#' 
#' @details
#' Holy shit was this hard. Okay, so it is doing a lot of things
#' and does it partially because it has to do a whole lot of error catching.
#' The data from the raw csv's are not standardized at all.
#' e.g. if there is no data recorded for the participant, then there is nothing
#' for that variable. This made things more complicated than if it were marked
#' but left empty or given some default NULL value. It wasn't though. The data
#' are stored in a long format. Most of the data that I cared about was
#' put into one column called responses, and was a character string
#' meshed with the variable name. It has to separate that out,
#' transpose that dataset into wide format, and then merge in mouseview
#' and stimuli data, along with participant and submission id information.
#' But the aforementioned issue made this process more complicated.
